# 🧙‍♂️ Hogwarts Google Apps

A magical journey into **Google Apps Script**, **CI/CD best practices**, and **modern web development**—all wrapped in a monorepo built to serve the administrative needs of the wizarding world. 🪄✨

## 📝 What is Hogwarts Google Apps?

**Hogwarts Google Apps** is a learning project designed to explore the full potential of **Google Apps Script** integrated with a **modern Angular frontend**, following **software engineering best practices** like:

- ✅ **CI/CD pipelines** for deploying Apps Script projects  
- ✅ **Unit testing** for both frontend and backend  
- ✅ **Monorepo architecture** to keep frontend (Angular) and backend (Apps Script) cleanly separated  

All of this is implemented under the whimsical use case of **Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry**—because even wizards need better document management! 📚🪶

## 🧾 Why Would Hogwarts Need This?

Despite centuries of magic, the Hogwarts administration has struggled with:

- 📄 Disorganized student records floating around in parchment  
- 🧾 Inconsistent class schedules and owl-based memos  
- 📁 Manual filing of magical creatures registration and potions incidents  

With **Google Apps Script**, Hogwarts can:

- Automate document creation for spell assignments and grade reports  
- Organize student data in dynamic Google Sheets dashboards  
- Streamline communication using Gmail scripts and templated documents  
- Offer a self-service web portal for professors and prefects  

A bit of Muggle tech might just be the trick to keep Hogwarts organized!
